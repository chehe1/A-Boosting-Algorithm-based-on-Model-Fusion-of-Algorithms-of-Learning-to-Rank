# A-Boosting-Algorithm-based-on-Model-Fusion-of-Algorithms-of-Learning-to-Rank
A rank aggregation framework with supervised learning. Firstly each sub-model is trained with each manually annotated query-document sequences and given a scoring weight to obtain the query features. To maximize the value of NDCGï¼Œ this paper uses the inverse trigonometric function with a coefficient to optimize the defined aggregation loss function to make it continuous and derivable. The appropriate values of coefficient and the weights are trained by the iterative method of gradient descent.The final scores of the documents are given by linear weighting of the weights of submodels and the scores given by sub-model. 
Before you run it by Eclipse, make sure that you have downloaded the dataset : MQ2007 or MQ2008 for supervised ranking from

And then don't forget to modify the code(from line 97 to line 99): String trainFile , String validationFile and String testFile.(default is C:/Users/Superman_he/Desktop/*)
